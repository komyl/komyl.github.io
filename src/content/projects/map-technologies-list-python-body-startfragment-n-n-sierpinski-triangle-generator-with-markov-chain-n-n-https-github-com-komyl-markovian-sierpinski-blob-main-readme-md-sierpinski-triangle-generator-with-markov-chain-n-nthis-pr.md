# Sierpinski Triangle Generator with Markov Chain

[](https://github.com/komyl/markovian-sierpinski/blob/main/README.md#sierpinski-triangle-generator-with-markov-chain)

This project generates the Sierpinski Triangle using a Markov chain-based approach. By combining a simple transition matrix with a random walk between the vertices of an equilateral triangle, the script creates a beautiful fractal pattern known as the Sierpinski triangle. It blends chaos theory and stochastic processes in an educational and visually appealing way.
